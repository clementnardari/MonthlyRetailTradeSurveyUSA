    "The MRTS database has been used to analyze sales trends in the US since 1992. The database has been extracted, transformed and loaded to a SQL database using Python and pandas. Then the database has been queried, manipulated and plotted to analyses specific trends. Retail and food services are trending up and are very seasonal. The book industry is very seasonal and is trending down. The sport goods are trending up and this trend has increased since the COVID pandemic. From the total closing sales of men and women, women sales represent around 80 percent of the total sales and this trend is trending up. Men sales are trending down and women sales have tended up in the 2000, then flat in the 2010 and the down in the 2015."

    "This project is about creating an Extract Transform and Load (ELT) process and analyzing the data of the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS). The MRTS database is composed of monthly retail sales data per category such as Electronics, food, drinks, cars, etc. This data if used properly could be very handy for government agencies, banks, retail groups and others. The first step of this project is to extract the data from the excel file and the second step is to transform the data to be then in a third step loaded to a SQL database. Python and its two libraries numpy and pandas will be used to execute the three steps. To make sure this process could be deployed to a larger team, the choice has been made to avoid any manual manipulations. To do that the excel file will be loaded as it with a panda function: read_excel and transformed directly in a Python function. Then after the transformation, it will be loaded into the sql data base with a panda function: to_sql. \n",
    "After that, the data loaded into the database will be queried and the analysis of the data can start to provise insights about the consumptions trends and habits in America from 1992 to 2020. "
